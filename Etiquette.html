                Visiting temple</div>
            <span>
                Behave calmly and respectfully. Show your respect by making a short prayer in front of the sacred object. Do so by throwing a coin into the offering box, followed by a short prayer. <br><br>

                At some temples, visitors burn incense (osenko) in large incense burners. Purchase a bundle, light them, let them burn for a few seconds and then extinguish the flame by waving your hand rather than by blowing it out. Finally, put the incense into the incense burner and fan some smoke towards yourself as the smoke is believed to have healing power. For example, fan some smoke towards your shoulder if you have an injured shoulder. <br><br>

                When entering temple buildings, you may be required to take off your shoes. Leave your shoes on the shelves at the entrance or take them with you in plastic bags provided at some temples. Wear nice socks. Remove hats. <br><br>

                Photography is usually permitted on the temple grounds, but is often forbidden inside the buildings. Watch for signs.

        <span>
            When using the washroom in minshuku or ryokan, you will often find toilet slippers for exclusive use inside the washroom. Leave your usual slippers outside the washroom, and do not forget to change back into them, afterwards, to avoid an often committed cultural faux pas.

            Travellers would like to enjoy the Onsen(溫泉) when they go to Japan. There are some rules you need to follow. <br>

            First get clean, then bathe. The baths themselves are for relaxing, so make sure to shower thoroughly before you get in. At onsen and sento, before you reach the baths you’ll enter a washing area where you can shower and get clean for the bath.
            No swimsuits. At traditional onsen and sento, swimsuits are not permitted. Some modern-day onsen “theme parks” do allow swimsuits, though these tend to lack the character and authenticity of real traditional baths! <br>
            At onsen you’ll be provided with two towels: one large and one small. The large one is for fully drying off after your relaxing soak; take the small one to (not into) the bath with you, however it’s important not to let the towel touch the water! Most Japanese people place the towel either on their head or on a nearby rock or other surface. (At sento the same rule applies, though you typically bring your own towel, or buy one for a small fee at the front desk).

    <div id="table">
        <div class="title">Table Manner</div>
        <span>
            Blowing your nose at the table, burping and audible munching are considered bad manners in Japan. On the other hand, it is considered good style to empty your dishes to the last grain of rice. If there are food items that you do not like or cannot eat, replacements may be available at restaurants or ryokan if you tell them in advance. Otherwise, it is advisable to leave the items on the dish. <br>

            After finishing your meal, it is generally good manner to return all your dishes to how they were at the start of the meal. This includes replacing the lids on dishes and putting your chopsticks back on the chopstick rest or in its paper holder. Conclude the meal with the phrase "gochisōsama deshita" ("thank you for the feast") which includes gratitude not only towards the cook but also the ingredients consumed. <br>

            Pour some soy sauce into the small dish provided. It is considered bad manners to waste soy sauce, so try not to pour more sauce than you will be using. <br>

            For Sushi, You do not need to add wasabi into the soy sauce, as sushi pieces that go well with wasabi will contain it already. However, if you choose to add wasabi, use only a small amount so as not to offend the sushi chef. If you do not like wasabi, you can request that none is added into your sushi. <br><br>

    <div id="payment">
        <div class="title">Payment</div>
        <span>
            In Japan, money is rarely passed directly from hand to hand. <br>

            When purchasing an item or service – rather than handing your money to the cashier – place your payment (whether cash or credit) on the small tray provided. This is where your change will be placed as well. <br><br>
            For travelers from countries where tipping is prevalent (such as the HK), it may feel odd to receive such amazing service and not leave a tip. <br>

            The fact is, tipping is simply not expected – it’s really not a part of Japanese culture – so if you leave a tip it will only cause confusion, and almost definitely won’t be accepted! <br>

            Unlike in many countries, even guides in Japan do not expect tips. However, it is acceptable to give your guide a tip if you feel so inclined (not at all required). If doing so, please make sure to first place the money into an envelope, and then politely hand the envelope to your guide (ideally while bowing and saying thank you!). <br>
